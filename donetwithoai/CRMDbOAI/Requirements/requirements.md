## 1. Introduction
The goal of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for our new customer relationship management system - henceforth referred to as MyCRM. 

> This section should provide an overview of the entire document

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document provides functional and non-functional requirements for the new MyCRM system. 

### 1.2 Product Scope
<!-- Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number.

These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.--> 

### 1.5 Document Overview
 This document is organized into five main sections:
 - Section 1 provides an introduction and overview of the MyCRM system
 - Section 2 describes the product overview including functions, constraints, and user characteristics
 - Section 3 specifies detailed functional and non-functional requirements
 - Section 4 outlines the verification and testing approach
 - Section 5 contains appendixes with additional reference material

## 2. Product Overview
MyCRM is a new customer relationship management application that is being developed. 
<!-- >> This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand. -->

### 2.1 Product Perspective
<!-- Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful. -->
The application should be designed to run initially as a standalone multi-ter web application that can also in the future be depoyed to Microsoft Azure's cloud with minimal changes. 

### 2.2 Product Functions
<!-- Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective. -->
There are two major business scenarios the application will focus on initially

1. Customer management - Functionality to manage the customers including the ability to:
1a. List customers - list all the customers in a table along with their details
1b. Add customer - functionality to add a new customer 
1c. Edit customer - the ability to edit a customer
1d. Delete customer - the ability to delete a customer. Deletions should be soft deletes - meaning the database retains the customer yet has a flag to track that the customer is deleted.

3. Customer outreach email - Functionality to enable an outreach email to be generated using GenAI. This functionality should allow:
-  One or more customer(s) to be selected from the list of active customers 
- Outreach template text to be provided. This should allow for 1000 characters of text to be provided that will provide the template for the email that will be sent. 
- Email preview - use  GenAI  to take the outreach template text and personalize including relevant user details such as contact name and / or company name from the selected user
- Email send - allow the user to then have the email be sent after approving the email preview 
- All emails sent must be stored in a database table for auditing purposes
-   Bulk email generation - when multiple customers are selected, the system shall generate personalized emails for each customer individually
-   Bulk email preview - display all generated emails in a summary view before sending
-   Bulk email sending - allow sending all approved emails with a single action

### 2.3 Product Constraints
<!--This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation. -->
After GenAI has been used to synthesize an email we need to review the generated text against Microsoft's responsible AI principles and summarize whether the email violates any of the principles. A summary must be provided before the email can be sent.  

### 2.4 User Characteristics
<!--Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy. -->
For the first version of this product there will be two user roles.
1. Power user - The power user can use both the customer management and customer outreach mail functionality.
2. Customer manager - This user can only use the customer management functionality and cannot use the customer outreach mail functionality.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
<!-- List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).--> 

This is a brand new system. It will initially be hosted on Windows Server and will be deployed on a locally managed servers but over time will likely move to Microsoft Azure. 

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
<!-- Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.

Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments). -->

The application should be constructed as multi-tier web application
1. Modern web browser like Edge, Firefox, Chrome etc
2. Service layer - Web server hosting services that encapsulate business logic 
3. Database - Microsoft SQL server 


## 3. Requirements

 - The system shall implement comprehensive logging using .NET's logging module
 - Log files shall be stored in the logs/ directory with rotation policy
 - Error logs shall include stack trace information for debugging
 - The system shall log all user authentication attempts (success and failure)
 - The system shall log all database operations and email sending activities

#### 3.3.1 Performance
<!--
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features. -->
The system should deliver all web pages to end users in under one second. The system should include telemetry for tracking TTFB and TTLB for each page along with content for a site adminstrator to view historical page load times and track % of pages delivered in under one second etc.
 - The system shall implement request timing middleware to measure page response times
 - Performance metrics shall be logged for administrative monitoring
 - The system shall be optimized for minimal database query overhead using connection pooling
 - Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) shall be served efficiently with appropriate caching headers 

#### 3.3.2 Security
<!-- Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied. --> 

Authentication requirements:
- The system will eventually be deployed on Azure and will use its Entra / oauth based authentication mechanism, however we also want to be able to run initially without Azure so the system should have a configurable authentication mechanism allowing for local authentication or Azure based authentication.
- For the local mechanism create a SQL table with users + ids + passwords to use as the basis for authentication. Make sure passwords are stored securely.

Authorization requirements:
- The system will eventually be deployed on Azure and will use Azure RBAC as the basis for authorization, however we also want to be able to run initially without Azure so the system should also have a basic authorization mechanism allowing for local authorization or Azure RBAC based authorization.
- For the initial authorization logic there should be two roles - administrator which can perform read + write operations, and a standard user which can only perform read only operations. 

User registration:
- The system should have a screen that only adminstrators can use that allow new users to be added / edited / deleted - and for passwords to be reset. 
- The adminstrator can determine whether a user is an admin or a standard user

Database security requirements: 
The system should be secure with at least the following factors considered:
- Database accounts - a new SQL account should be created for the service layer to authenticate with database against 
- Database authentication - no passwords should be stored in code at all. Passwords will be referenced in system environment variables.  

Additional security requirements: 
- Web server session state should be secured appropriately to ensure users have to be authenticated before accessing the web application
- Database queries - all queries from service layer should be evaluated for threats such as sql injection


#### 3.3.3 Reliability
<!-- Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery. --> 

#### 3.3.4 Availability
<!-- Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart. --> 

### 3.4 Compliance
<!-- Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations, including:  
* Report format
* Data naming
* Accounting procedures
* Audit tracing

For example, this could specify the requirement for software to trace processing activity. Such traces are needed for some applications to meet minimum regulatory or financial standards. An audit trace requirement may, for example, state that all changes to a payroll database shall be recorded in a trace file with before and after values. -->

Health Care Industry Compliance Requirements: 
- This system is initially being deployed for a health care customer so its important to ensure HIPPA requirements are being considered including - how customer data is being stored as well as any requirements related to the information that is generated in the mock emails. 
- The system should also keep a log of all emails that are sent. Prior to sending the proposed email should be sent to the GenAI service to determine suitability for sending according to HIPPA regulations.  
- In the future it is possible that other industries compliance requirements will also have to be met - so ensure the HIPPA logic is configurable. 

Responsible AI Requirements:
- Given the system is using AI to personalize the email also include a requirement to verify the generated email against Microsoft's responsible AI principles - in addition to any HIPPA requirements.

### 4.0 Design and Implementation

#### 4.1 Enterprise Application Reference Architecture

The application shall follow our standard enterprise application reference architecture including:

Multi-Layer Architecture:
- Presentation Layer: Web browser, HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Application Layer: ASP.NET for MVC framework, controllers, routing

## 5. Verification
<!-- >> This section provides the verification approaches and methods planned to qualify the software. The information items for verification are recommended to be given in a parallel manner with the requirement items in Section 3. The purpose of the verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system or system element fulfills its specified requirements and characteristics. -->
The system should develop layers incrementally starting in the following order:
- Create the databases, tables and sql accounts
- Create stored procedures for all CRUD operations required for each table
- Create services to host business logic and interact with backend database
- Create unit tests to test all code generated
- Create web application to call services
- Create functional tests to test major areas of functionality 

After each layer is created create an overview document and allow me to review prior to proceeding 

<!-- TODO: give more guidance, similar to section 3 -->
